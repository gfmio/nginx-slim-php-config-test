# nginx Slim PHP Config Test

This is a small test project providing a fully functional standard config file for a PHP application using the Slim micro framework with nginx. The config file should be in the sites-available folder of your nginx config, the files in the src folder should go to the public server directory. The paths in the config file need to be adjusted accordingly.

It provides the server config for nginx as well as a test index file using sample routing for testing purposes. A sample block for routing to static files is also provided. However, better place these in a separate assets directory or serve them using a CDN.
